                React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are
                handled,
                how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.
                <br><br>
                Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React
                separates
                concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to
                components in a
                further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you
                otherwise.
                <br><br>
                React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI
                inside the
                JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.</p>

                <header class="hero">
                    <h1>Variable Declaration</h1>

                It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to
                describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the
                full power of JavaScript.</p>
