                Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of
                websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI
                design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX
                design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different
                aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is
                normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website
                including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web
                development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web
                accessibility guidelines.
                <br><br>
                Web designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the production process they are
                involved in. These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the principles behind
                them remain the same. Web designers use both vector and raster graphics editors to create web-formatted
                imagery or design prototypes. A website can be created using WYSIWYG website builder software or content
                management system, or the individual web pages can be hand-coded in just the same manner as the first
                web pages were created. Other tools web designers might use include mark up validators[8] and other
                testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their websites meet web accessibility
                guidelines.

                Marketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its target market. This can
                be an age group or particular strand of culture; thus the designer may understand the trends of its
                audience. Designers may also understand the type of website they are designing, meaning, for example,
                that (B2B) business-to-business website design considerations might differ greatly from a consumer
                targeted website such as a retail or entertainment website.
                <br><br>
                Careful consideration might be made to
                ensure that the aesthetics or overall design of a site do not clash with the clarity and accuracy of the
                content or the ease of web navigation,[10] especially on a B2B website. Designers may also consider the
                reputation of the owner or business the site is representing to make sure they are portrayed favourably.
